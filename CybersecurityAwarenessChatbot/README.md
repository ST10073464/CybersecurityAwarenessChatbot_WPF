ure# Part 1: Cybersecurity Awareness Chatbot 

## Overview
The **Cybersecurity Awareness Chatbot** is a C# console application developed using **.NET 8**.  
The purpose of this chatbot is to educate users about common cybersecurity threats such as phishing attacks, weak passwords, and unsafe browsing practices.

The chatbot interacts with users through a simple conversational interface and provides guidance on how to stay safe online. This project forms part of a **Programming Portfolio of Evidence (POE)** and demonstrates concepts such as user input, string manipulation, console UI design, and structured programming.

---

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project are to:

- Develop a **console application that interacts with users**
- Implement **string manipulation for chatbot responses**
- Use **automatic properties in C#**
- Improve console applications using **ASCII art and colour formatting**
- Implement **voice greeting functionality**
- Practice **GitHub version control and Continuous Integration**

---

## Features

### 1. Voice Greeting
When the chatbot launches, it plays a **voice greeting (WAV file)** to welcome the user.

```
hello.wav is inside the folder audio and is played using the System.Media.SoundPlayer class in C#.
```
Example greeting:
```
Hello! Welcome to the SecureWin.
I'm here to help you stay safe online.
```

---

### 2. ASCII Art Logo
The chatbot displays an **ASCII cybersecurity-themed logo** when the program starts.

This improves the visual appearance of the console interface.

---

### 3. Personalised User Interaction
The chatbot asks the user for their name and uses it to personalise responses.

Example:

```
Please enter your name: Erwin

Hello Erwin!
Welcome to the Cybersecurity Awareness Bot.
```

---

### 4. Cybersecurity Chatbot Responses
The chatbot can answer basic cybersecurity questions including:

- How are you?
- What is your purpose?
- What can I ask you about?
- Password safety
- Phishing attacks
- Safe browsing

Example interaction:

```
You: What is phishing?

Bot: Phishing is when attackers trick you into revealing personal
information through fake emails or websites.
```

---

### 5. Input Validation
The chatbot detects invalid input such as:

- Empty messages
- Unsupported questions

Example:

```
Bot: I didn’t quite understand that. Could you rephrase?
```

---

### 6. Enhanced Console User Interface
The application uses:

- Console colours
- Decorative borders
- ASCII art
- Structured text layout

This improves readability and user experience.

---

## Technologies Used

- **C#**
- **.NET 8 Console Application**
- **System.Media (SoundPlayer)**
- **GitHub**
- **GitHub Actions (CI)**
